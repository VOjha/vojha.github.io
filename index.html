    <h1>Hi, welcome to my website!</h1>

    <p>My name is Vidushi Ojha (she/her/hers) and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm advised by Dr Colleen Lewis. My work focuses on broadening participation in computing (BPC) and aims to improve the experiences of students from historically underrepresented groups in computing. I'm particularly interested in how policies and practices can impact outcomes such as students' sense of belonging and confidence in computing.</p>
    
    <p>Prior to grad school, I grew up in India and Switzerland. I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College (class of 2017) in Claremont, CA. After graduating, I spent a couple of years in LA as a software engineer for Originate, Inc., before starting my PhD in 2019. I'm on the faculty job market this year!</p>
