    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>My name is Vidushi Ojha (she/her/hers) and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm advised by Dr Colleen Lewis. My work focuses on <strong>broadening participation in computing (BPC)</strong> and aims to improve the experiences of students from historically underrepresented groups in computing. I'm particularly interested in how <strong>policies and practices</strong> can impact outcomes such as students' <strong>sense of belonging</strong> and <strong>computing self-efficacy</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Prior to grad school, I grew up in India and Switzerland. I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College (class of 2017) in Claremont, CA. After graduating, I spent a couple of years in LA as a software engineer for Originate, Inc., before starting my PhD in 2019. I'm on the faculty job market this year!</p>
