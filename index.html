<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>My name is Vidushi Ojha (she/her/hers) and I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Harvey Mudd College.</p>

    <p>My research in computer science education focuses on <strong>broadening participation in computing</strong> and aims to improve the experiences of students from <strong>historically underrepresented groups in computing</strong>. I'm particularly interested in how <strong>policies and practices</strong> can impact outcomes such as students' <strong>sense of belonging</strong> and <strong>computing self-efficacy</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>I grew up in India and Switzerland. I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College (class of 2017) in Claremont, CA. After graduating, I spent a couple of years in Los Angeles, CA as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.originate.com/">Originate, Inc.</a>, before starting my PhD in 2019. I completed my PhD in 2024 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iOWg8rsAAAAJ">Dr. Colleen Lewis</a>.</p>
